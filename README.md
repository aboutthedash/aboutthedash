- 👋 Hi, I’m @aboutthedash
- 👀 I’m interested in figuring out how Gatsby and headless stacks like Contentstack work.
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning a lot of things because my hands-on coding skills are a little rusty. I have been working with the front-end and in browser testing for a little too long at work! 
- 💞️ I would love to collaborate on things in the future but right now I need to upskill! :)
